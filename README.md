### Project Outline

- A basic explanation of the project, not too much detail.

### Research

#### Methodology

- The process of research, testing, how you want to approach your project.
    - You will be looking examples of first person horror games.
    - You will doing guided testing and collecting data.

#### Game Sources

- Slenderman (Slender Man, 2013).
    - It is a good game, because people like it (Slenderman Must Die: Silent Streets 🕹️ Play on CrazyGames, s.d.).

#### Academic Sources

- An academic source of some description, which guided you (Smith, 2018).

#### Documentation Sources

- Youtube tutorials
- Documentation like on unreals.

### Implementation

#### Process

- how you the game, how you make the game work.

#### New Approaches

- First time using Godot.
    - I looked more into documentation as opposed to youtube tutorials.
    - I focused heavily on content.

#### User Testing

- Talk about how users felt on the first.
- Show some data.
- Talk about a second test, or benchmark.

### Outcome

- A Youtube Video Of demonstrating the game.
- Trailer (if you want to).
- Link to itch
- Figma Board
- Trello Board

#### Instructions To Install/Run

- Instructions to interact with the source code.
- Or to make the game, if it has a weird toolchain.

### Reflection

#### Research Effectiveness

- Did the research you do, helpful?

#### Positive Analysis

- The game was enjoyable to users.
- I got a lot of early beta testers via itch.
- The things that went well.

#### Negative Analysis

- What did not go so good.
- Things that got skipped from research.
- Lack of good user testing data.

#### Next Time

- What you learned and now want do more of.
- What is guiding your interests.

### Declared Assets

- This ai was used to amend or alter the following files.
    - Model of ai (for example Gemini3.0, Perplexity).
    - The file that was modified (README.md).
